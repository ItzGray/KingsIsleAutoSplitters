# KingsIsle Auto Splitters
Hello! This is a repository to house LiveSplit auto splitters for the KingsIsle games Wizard101 and Pirate101.
A few notes: 
1. This is still being developed. Issues and limitations can and will inevitably pop up.
2. The Pirate101 auto splitter is still currently in a state that it cannot be released in. Stay tuned for it!



Here's where all the settings cause splits to happen as well as some other details if necessary:

#### Note: All of the category ending splits (except for Die%) are slightly inaccurately timed compared to the actual timing standards. This is a limitation of the auto-splitter, but can be compensated for during verification by retiming.
