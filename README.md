# KingsIsle Auto Splitters
Hello! This is a repository to house LiveSplit auto splitters for the KingsIsle games Wizard101 and Pirate101.
A few notes:
1. This is still being developed. Issues and limitations can and will inevitably pop up.
2. When using the auto splitter, take care to make sure your quest helper arrow is connected to the quest you are actually doing. (Except in the case of the Olivia side quest, as doing that breaks this version)
3. The Pirate101 auto splitter is still currently in a state that it cannot be released in. Stay tuned for it!



Here's where all the settings cause splits to happen as well as some other details if necessary:
