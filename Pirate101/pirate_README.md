# How to Set Up the Load Remover
Make sure the "Load Time Removal" setting is enabled in the auto-splitter settings. It should be enabled by default.

Add a separate Timer (or Detailed Timer) into your LiveSplit layout, and set the Timing Method to "Game Time". Afterwards, the load remover should work.
# Pirate101 Split Info
